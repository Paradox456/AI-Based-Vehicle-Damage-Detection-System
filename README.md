# 🚗 AI-Based Vehicle Damage Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages **computer vision and deep learning** to automatically detect and assess vehicle damage from images or videos. It is designed for **insurance companies, car rental services, and auto repair shops** to automate damage assessment, reducing human error and processing time.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🏎️ **Vehicle Detection** – Identifies vehicles in images using **YOLOv8/Faster R-CNN**.
- 🔍 **Damage Classification** – Recognizes different types of vehicle damage (scratches, dents, broken parts).
- 📊 **Severity Estimation** – Categorizes damage severity as **Minor, Moderate, or Severe**.
- 📄 **Automatic Report Generation** – Provides a structured report detailing detected damages.
- 🌐 **REST API (Flask)** – Upload an image and get a damage prediction via an API.
- 🖥 **Web Interface (Optional)** – Use **Streamlit/Flask** for a user-friendly interface.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **OpenCV** – Image processing
- **YOLOv8 / Faster R-CNN** – Vehicle detection
- **TensorFlow/Keras / PyTorch** – Deep learning model training
- **Flask / FastAPI** – API development
